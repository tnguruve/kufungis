Goal of the website:
In this Mental Health project, I’m building  a website using Django, bootstrap, html and css.  
The website is meant to help users normalize talking about mental health by educating users on mental health issues, and offering nearby  resources e.g. clinics, psychiatrists, therapy.

Passion: Creating Technologies that benefit the developing countries and the minority. 

What inspired me
Bias that black people don’t need therapy, Poor detection rate due to poor health systems caused by the increasingly bad socioeconomic environment(Zimbabwe), Suicide rates going up.

Background:
I partnered with healthcare Zimbabwe because the goal is for the  chatbot tobe  filled with psychologist-designed guided self-help paths, mood/health tracking, relaxation techniques, and community support. 
The ultimate goal is not to replace real doctors but to raise awareness on the issue. It is to offer a starting point for people who are not aware of mental health, provide a private, and stigma-free environment.
